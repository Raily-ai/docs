## Overview

Raily is built around four core concepts that work together to give you complete control over your content in the AI era:

## Content

Content is the foundation of Raily. It represents any digital asset you want to protect and monetize.

### Content Structure

Every piece of content in Raily has:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `id` | Unique Raily identifier | `cnt_abc123xyz` |
| `externalId` | Your internal identifier | `article-456` |
| `title` | Human-readable name | "Q4 Market Report" |
| `type` | Content category | `article`, `report`, `image` |
| `source` | Original location | `https://example.com/...` |
| `metadata` | Custom attributes | Author, date, tags |
| `policyId` | Applied access policy | `pol_xyz789` |

### Content Types

Raily supports various content types, each optimized for different use cases:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Articles & Blog Posts" icon="newspaper">
    Text-based content like news articles, blog posts, and editorial content.

    ```javascript
    const article = await raily.content.create({

    B --> D[Delete]
    C --> B
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete">
    Permanently remove content and associated data
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Policies

Policies are the rules that govern how AI systems can access your content. They're powerful, flexible, and designed for complex real-world scenarios.

### Policy Structure

```javascript
{
  id: "pol_xyz789",
  name: "Enterprise Access Policy",
  description: "Controls access for enterprise AI partners",
  rules: [
    {
      action: "allow",
      priority: 1,
      conditions: { /* when this rule applies */ },
      permissions: [ /* what the requester can do */ ],
      rateLimit: { /* usage limits */ }
    },
    // ... more rules
  ],
  defaultAction: "deny"
}
```

### Rule Evaluation

Rules are evaluated in priority order. The first matching rule determines the outcome.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Access Request] --> B{Rule 1 matches?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Apply Rule 1]
    B -->|No| D{Rule 2 matches?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Apply Rule 2]
    D -->|No| F{More rules?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Check next rule]
    F -->|No| H[Apply default action]
```

### Conditions

Conditions determine when a rule applies:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Identity">
    ```javascript
    conditions: {
      requesterId: ["partner_openai", "partner_anthropic"],
      requesterType: "ai_provider"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="License">
    ```javascript
    conditions: {
      hasValidLicense: true,
      licenseType: ["enterprise", "professional"],
      licenseExpiry: { after: "now" }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Usage">
    ```javascript
    conditions: {
      purpose: ["training", "inference"],
      commercialUse: false
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Time">
    ```javascript
    conditions: {
      time: {
        after: "2024-01-01",
        before: "2024-12-31",
        daysOfWeek: ["monday", "friday"]
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Permissions

Permissions define what actions are allowed:

| Permission | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `full_access` | Complete content access |
| `preview_only` | Limited preview (first 500 chars) |
| `metadata_only` | Access to metadata, not content |
| `commercial_use` | Can use in commercial applications |
| `training` | Can use for AI model training |
| `inference` | Can use for AI inference only |

### Rate Limiting

Control usage volume to prevent abuse and manage costs:

```javascript
rateLimit: {
  requests: 1000,      // Maximum requests
  period: "hour",      // Time window: minute, hour, day, month
  burst: 100,          // Allow short bursts above limit
  scope: "requester"   // Apply per requester or globally
}
```

### Policy Example: Tiered Access

```javascript
const tieredPolicy = await raily.policies.create({
  name: "Tiered Content Access",
  rules: [
    // Enterprise: Full access, high limits
    {
      action: "allow",
      priority: 1,
      conditions: { licenseType: "enterprise" },
      permissions: ["full_access", "commercial_use", "training"],
      rateLimit: { requests: 10000, period: "hour" }
    },
    // Professional: Full access, moderate limits
    {
      action: "allow",
      priority: 2,
      conditions: { licenseType: "professional" },
      permissions: ["full_access", "commercial_use"],
      rateLimit: { requests: 1000, period: "hour" }
    },
    // Basic: Preview only, low limits
    {
      action: "allow",
      priority: 3,
      conditions: { licenseType: "basic" },
      permissions: ["preview_only"],
      rateLimit: { requests: 100, period: "day" }
    },
    // Default: Deny all others
    {
      action: "deny",
      priority: 99,
      conditions: { default: true },
      message: "Please obtain a license to access this content"
    }
  ]
});
```

## Access Requests

When an AI system wants to use your content, it sends an access request. Raily evaluates the request against your policies and returns a decision.

### Request Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant AI as AI System
    participant R as Raily
    participant C as Your Content

    AI->>R: Access Request
    R->>R: Evaluate Policies
    R->>R: Check Rate Limits
    alt Access Granted
        R->>AI: Signed URL + Token
        AI->>C: Fetch Content
        R->>R: Log Analytics
    else Access Denied
        R->>AI: Denial Reason
        R->>R: Log Analytics
    end
```

### Request Structure

```javascript
const request = await raily.access.check({
  contentId: "cnt_abc123",
  requesterId: "partner_openai",
  context: {
    purpose: "inference",
    model: "gpt-4",
    userAgent: "OpenAI-API/1.0",
    ipAddress: "192.168.1.1"
  }
});
```

### Response Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Granted">
    ```javascript
    {
      allowed: true,
      contentUrl: "https://cdn.raily.ai/...",
      token: "ey...",
      expiresAt: "2024-01-20T11:00:00Z",
      permissions: ["full_access", "inference"],
      rateLimit: {
        remaining: 999,
        resetAt: "2024-01-20T11:00:00Z"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Denied">
    ```javascript
    {
      allowed: false,
      reason: "rate_limit_exceeded",
      message: "Hourly request limit reached",
      retryAfter: "2024-01-20T11:00:00Z"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
