## Overview

AI Servers in Raily are endpoints that let you expose your data collections to AI agents and applications in a trusted, authenticated, and transparent way. Each AI Server is an endpoint configured with specific authentication and data integration settings.

## What is an AI Server?

An AI Server endpoint is configured with:

- **Authentication** - Specific Identity Provider (IDP) for secure access
- **Data Integration** - Specific data collection or integration you choose to expose
- **Full Analytics** - Complete monitoring including latency, calls, and usage metrics

Raily manages these endpoints and provides comprehensive analytics on their usage.

## How AI Servers Work

Each AI Server endpoint:

1. **Authenticates requests** via your configured IDP
2. **Serves data** from your chosen data collection or integration
3. **Tracks all activity** with detailed analytics
4. **Enforces access policies** based on your configuration

## Endpoint Configuration

An AI Server endpoint is configured with:

### Identity Provider (IDP)

Connect the AI Server to a specific IDP for authentication:

- OAuth providers
- API key authentication
- Custom authentication systems
- White-label authentication

### Data Collection

Choose which data collection or integration the endpoint exposes:

- Specific content collections
- Vector store data
- External data integrations
- Storage buckets

## Analytics

Raily provides full analytics for each AI Server endpoint, including:

- **Total Calls** - Number of requests to the endpoint
- **Average Response Time** - Latency metrics
- **Total Input Tokens** - Tokens sent in requests
- **Total Output Tokens** - Tokens returned in responses
- **Average Input/Output Tokens** - Per-request averages
- **Access patterns over time** - Timeline of usage

Access analytics through the Raily dashboard at [app.raily.ai/dashboard](https://app.raily.ai/dashboard).

## Trusted and Transparent

AI Server endpoints provide:

- **Trust** - Authentication on every request
- **Transparency** - Full visibility into who accesses what
- **Control** - Configure exactly what data is exposed
- **Analytics** - Detailed metrics on all usage
