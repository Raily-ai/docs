## Overview

Discoverability in Raily refers to how AI systems can find, understand, and access your content. Raily helps you measure and optimize how LLMs discover and select your data and AI servers.

## Why Discoverability Matters

AI systems need to discover the right content at the right time. Effective discoverability ensures:

- **Relevance** - AI finds the most appropriate content for each query
- **Efficiency** - Reduced time and cost in content retrieval
- **Context** - AI understands the purpose and structure of your content
- **Selection** - Your content is chosen by LLMs when relevant

## Discoverability Metrics

Track how your data and AI servers are being selected by LLMs through the Raily dashboard at [app.raily.ai/dashboard](https://app.raily.ai/dashboard).

### Total Tests

The total number of discoverability tests performed to measure how LLMs find and select your content.

### Discovery Rate

The rate at which your data and AI servers are successfully discovered by LLMs.

### Passed Tests

The number of tests where your data/AI servers were successfully discovered and selected by LLMs.

### Failed Tests

The number of tests where your data/AI servers were not discovered or selected by LLMs.

### Discoverability by Prompt Complexity

A breakdown showing how discoverability varies across different levels of prompt complexity, helping you understand which types of queries surface your content.

### Confusion Matrix

A confusion matrix visualization showing the accuracy of discovery predictions versus actual selections by LLMs.

## Key Elements of Discoverability

### Metadata

Comprehensive metadata helps AI systems understand your content:

- Titles and descriptions
- Categories and tags
- Authors and publication dates
- Topics and keywords
- Language and format

### Content Organization

Structured organization improves AI comprehension:

- Content hierarchies
- Collections and groupings
- Taxonomies and categories
- Related content relationships

### Access Information

Clear information about content availability:

- Access levels and requirements
- License types and terms
- Usage restrictions and permissions
- Pricing and contact information
