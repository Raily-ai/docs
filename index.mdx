As AI systems increasingly rely on specialized and IP rich data, organizations need a reliable way to serve this data directly to AI.

Raily enables data companies to connect their data once and serve it to AI systems in a trusted and transparent way. Data can be stored and indexed in Raily or connected from existing data and vector systems. There is no need to build or maintain custom delivery pipelines. Raily handles the processing, indexing, authentication, analytics, and trust controls needed to make data available for AI use.

## Who We Are

Raily is built by a team with deep experience in content, data trust, and security, with years of work alongside organizations where specialized and IP-rich data is a core asset and trust and control are essential. Raily is designed to make this data available to AI systems in a trusted and transparent way.
