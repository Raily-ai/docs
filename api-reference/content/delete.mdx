curl -X DELETE https://api.raily.ai/v1/content/cnt_abc123xyz \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer raily_sk_xxxxx"
```

```javascript JavaScript

if (result.deleted) {
  console.log(`Deleted content: ${result.id}`);
}
```

result = raily.content.delete("cnt_abc123xyz")

if result.deleted:
    print(f"Deleted content: {result.id}")
```

</RequestExample>

<ResponseExample>

```json Success (200)
{
  "id": "cnt_abc123xyz",
  "object": "content",
  "deleted": true
}
```

```json Not Found (404)
{
  "error": {
    "code": "content_not_found",
    "message": "Content with ID 'cnt_invalid' not found",
    "type": "not_found_error"
  }
}
```

</ResponseExample>

## Alternative: Archive Instead of Delete

If you want to disable access but preserve data:

```javascript
// Archive - preserves data, disables access
await raily.content.update('cnt_abc123xyz', {
  status: 'archived'
});

// Later, restore if needed
await raily.content.update('cnt_abc123xyz', {
  status: 'active'
});
```

## Bulk Delete

To delete multiple content items:

```javascript
const ids = ['cnt_abc123', 'cnt_def456', 'cnt_ghi789'];

const results = await raily.content.bulkDelete({ ids });

console.log(`Deleted: ${results.deleted}`);
console.log(`Failed: ${results.failed}`);
```
