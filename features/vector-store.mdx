## Capabilities

### Semantic Search

Search by meaning, not just keywords. Vector embeddings enable AI systems to find relevant content based on semantic similarity.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Build Retrieval-Augmented Generation applications that combine vector search with LLM capabilities.

### Metadata Filtering

Search with filters based on metadata like category, date, author, or custom fields.

### Hybrid Search

Combine semantic similarity search with traditional keyword matching for optimal results.

## Vector Store Management

- Index content with vector embeddings
- Update vectors when content changes
- Delete vectors when content is removed
- Batch operations for efficiency

## Integration with Providers

Connect to various vector store providers:

- **Qdrant** - High-performance vector search
- **S3 Vectors** - Cost-effective storage in Amazon S3
- **Raily Vector Store** - Managed solution with instant setup
