## API Key Authentication

The primary authentication method for server-to-server communication. API keys provide simple, secure authentication for accessing your content programmatically.

### Managing API Keys

- Create new API keys with specific scopes
- Set expiration dates for enhanced security
- List and manage all active API keys
- Revoke keys when needed

## OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 provides standard authentication for user-facing applications. Configure OAuth settings, exchange authorization codes for access tokens, and securely authenticate user requests.

## White Label Authentication

Integrate your existing authentication system with Raily. Configure custom authentication providers, use your own JWT tokens, and maintain your existing user management infrastructure.

## Token Management

### Access Tokens

Generate short-lived access tokens for secure, temporary access to resources.

### Refresh Tokens

Use refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens without requiring re-authentication.

## Multi-Factor Authentication

Add an extra security layer with multi-factor authentication (MFA). Support for time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) and backup codes.
