## Overview

Publishers and media companies are sitting on valuable content that AI systems want to access. Raily helps you monetize this content while maintaining control over how it's used.

## The Challenge

AI companies are training models and building applications using publisher content. Without proper controls:

- You don't know who's using your content
- You can't enforce licensing terms
- You miss out on significant revenue opportunities
- Your content may be used in ways you didn't authorize

---

## The Raily Solution

### 1. Register Your Content Catalog

Connect your CMS to automatically sync your article archive:

```javascript
// WordPress integration
add_filter('raily_content_metadata', function($metadata, $post) {
    return array_merge($metadata, [
        'author' => get_the_author(),
        'section' => get_the_category()[0]->name,
        'premium' => get_post_meta($post->ID, '_premium_content', true),
        'wordCount' => str_word_count($post->post_content)
    ]);
}, 10, 2);
```

### 2. Create Tiered Access Policies

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Free Content">
    Allow broad access to non-premium content:

    ```javascript
    const freePolicy = await raily.policies.create({
      name: "Free Content",
      rules: [
        {
          action: "allow",
          conditions: { "content.metadata.premium": false },
          permissions: ["full_access", "inference"],
          rateLimit: { requests: 100, period: "day" }
        }
      ]
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Premium Content">
    Require licensing for premium articles:

    ```javascript
    const premiumPolicy = await raily.policies.create({
      name: "Premium Content",
      rules: [
        {
          action: "allow",
          priority: 1,
          conditions: {
            hasValidLicense: true,
            licenseType: ["enterprise", "news"]
          },
          permissions: ["full_access", "inference"]
        },
        {
          action: "deny",
          priority: 99,
          conditions: { default: true },
          message: "Contact licensing@yourpublication.com for access"
        }
      ]
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Archive Content">
    Special terms for historical content:

    ```javascript
    const archivePolicy = await raily.policies.create({
      name: "Archive Access",
      rules: [
        {
          action: "allow",
          conditions: {
            licenseType: "archive",
            "content.metadata.publishedAt": { before: "2020-01-01" }
          },
          permissions: ["full_access", "training"]
        }
      ]
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 3. Block Training Without License

Many publishers want to allow inference (chatbots citing their work) but block training (using content to train models):

```javascript
const noTrainingPolicy = await raily.policies.create({
  name: "Inference Only",
  rules: [
    // Block all training
    {
      action: "deny",
      priority: 1,
      conditions: { purpose: ["training", "fine_tuning"] },
      message: "Training use requires a separate license"
    },
    // Allow inference for licensed partners
    {
      action: "allow",
      priority: 2,
      conditions: {
        hasValidLicense: true,
        purpose: ["inference", "rag"]
      },
      permissions: ["full_access"]
    }
  ]
});
```

## Real-World Examples

### News Organization

**Challenge**: A major news organization wanted to monetize their 20-year article archive while blocking unauthorized AI training.

**Solution**:
- Synced 500,000+ articles to Raily via their CMS

- Set up revenue tracking and automated reporting

**Results**:
- $2M+ new annual revenue from AI licensing
- 100% visibility into content usage
- Zero unauthorized training access

### Magazine Publisher

**Challenge**: A magazine publisher wanted to offer their premium content to AI applications while maintaining exclusivity.

**Solution**:
- Registered premium content with restrictive policies
- Created exclusive partnerships with 3 AI providers
- Implemented rate limits to control access volume
- Set up webhooks for real-time monitoring

**Results**:
- Exclusive AI partnerships generating recurring revenue

## Sample Policy: News Publisher

```javascript
// Complete policy setup for a news publisher
const setupNewsPublisher = async () => {
  // Free content - recent news
  const freePolicy = await raily.policies.create({
    name: "Free News",
    rules: [
      {
        action: "allow",
        conditions: {
          "content.metadata.section": "breaking-news",
          "content.metadata.publishedAt": { after: "now-7d" }
        },
        permissions: ["full_access", "inference"],
        rateLimit: { requests: 50, period: "day" }
      }
    ]
  });

  // Premium content - analysis & investigations
  const premiumPolicy = await raily.policies.create({
    name: "Premium Analysis",
    rules: [
      {
        action: "allow",
        priority: 1,
        conditions: {
          hasValidLicense: true,
          licenseFeatures: ["premium_access"]
        },
        permissions: ["full_access", "inference"]
      },
      {
        action: "allow",
        priority: 2,
        conditions: { hasValidLicense: true },
        permissions: ["preview_only"]  // 500 char preview
      }
    ]
  });

  // Archive - training allowed with specific license
  const archivePolicy = await raily.policies.create({
    name: "Archive Training",
    rules: [
      {
        action: "allow",
        conditions: {
          licenseType: "training",
          "content.metadata.publishedAt": { before: "now-1y" }
        },
        permissions: ["full_access", "training", "fine_tuning"]
      }
    ]
  });

  return { freePolicy, premiumPolicy, archivePolicy };
};
```

## Revenue Tracking

Monitor your AI licensing revenue:

```javascript
const monthlyReport = await raily.analytics.revenue({
  period: "month",
  groupBy: "day"
});

console.log(`Monthly Revenue: $${monthlyReport.summary.total}`);
console.log(`Growth vs Last Month: ${monthlyReport.summary.changePercent}%`);
console.log(`\nTop Partners:`);
monthlyReport.byRequester.forEach(partner => {
  console.log(`  ${partner.name}: $${partner.revenue}`);
});
```
